~> BLGR <~

very crude and minimal cron-based static blog engine written in under 100 lines of python


~> Why

- I need a blog for my webapps
- I don't and don't intend to run apache/php/mysql to have Wordpress (and it's too big and a security liability)
- I used blogger but that doesn't give me any seo juice 
	(you can only make it part of your website on DNS level, so with a subdomain. Google sees subdomains as
	different websites altogether)
- I don't want to install/run anything additional on the app machine to have a blog
- So I need a static blog
- I wrote posts in raw html in WP/blogger anyway, so vim + html code for posts is all I need (markdown could be simply added)


~> Why python

- it's already installed on most linux servers and is more reasonable than alternatives (php, perl..)
- it has the regex and markdown libs

~> How to blog

- Add posts as separate files in inbox folder
- run blgr.py or set is as a cronjob


~> Conventions

- first <h2> in a post file is a title of the file.


~ Future

- files that begin with zzz__ are already turned into posts and should get deleted periodically (will add)
- index page generation will get a little fancyer once I have enough blogposts to care and test it..
