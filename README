Crude static blog engine written in under 100 lines of python.


Why
---

- I need a blog for my webapps
- I don't and don't intend to run apache/php/mysql just to have Wordpress (and it's too big and a big security liability)
- I used blogger but that doesn't give me any seo juice 
	(you can only make it part of your website on DNS level, so with a subdomain. 
	But google sees subdomains as a different websites altogether)
- I don't want to install/run anything additional on the app machine to have a blog
- So I need a static blog
- I wrote posts in raw html in WP/blogger anyway(I hate WYSIWYG), so emacs + html code for posts is all I need 
  (markdown could be simply added)


Why python
----------

- it's already installed on most linux servers and is more reasonable than alternatives (php, perl..) to me
- it has the needed libs


How to blog
-----------

- after you setup your getmail (example in _stuff/getmailrc) you just send emails to specified email


Conventions

- first <h2/> becomes the title, is used in index and to create a slug / filename


~ Future

- add email commands for editind and deleting blogposts
- make better getmail / procmail / formail example setup that won't let anyone post, etc ..
- index page generation will have to get a little fancier once I have enough blogposts to care and test it
- we could do so that thing would accept multipart emails and take the html part (not sure if it's really needed)
- we could extract attachments and make small gallery of images, turn docs to download links etc
- we could use zemanta to enrichen the blogpost...
