<h2>Hello World & Hello [blgr]</h2>

<p>Our products are getting out and we'll have some time to sit back and blog. (yeah right!;)</p>

<p>I created this static bloging "engine" called [blgr] specially for this occasion. It's open source and really really minimal. 
I wouldn't use it yet, if I were you ;). But it will get more solid in next weeks when I do use it here and to make our products' blogs.</p>

<p>See you next time, on a real blogpost!</p>
